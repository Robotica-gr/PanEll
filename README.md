Autonomous robotic system, that checks, maintains and replaces faulty solar panels.
Below, you can read a hypothetical scenario of a dialog between our team and a Sola Panel Field owner. Through the convertation we want to describe the core benefits of our robotic system.

-TEAM: We are team Panell from Greece and our project is an automatic autonomous robot that  maintains and replaces solar panels. 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: We have solar farms and we are in the process of replacing all of the installed solar panels . We  saw you on the national news presenting an innovative project that can replace panels that are  problematic. We have a problem because when some of them get damaged, the energy  production of the entire solar panel array decreases, and we have to search for the damaged 
ones. 

-TEAM: Is that your only problem? 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: I guess we replace them because they have completed their life cycle and their performance has  dropped by 80%, it's time for them to get recycled. 

-TEAM: You know that performance hasn't dropped in all of them, right? 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: Maybe but we cannot check each one separately. We look at the performance of the whole field. 

-TEAM: Wouldn't it be nice if you could monitor the performance of each solar panel separately? 
 
-POTENTIAL BUYERS: That's possible!? 

-TEAM: Our robotic system {we show a model}, is very simple in terms of  manufacturing, because it  consists of two rails on which this autonomous bridge moves. It's powered by the sun and scans  each solar panel one by one whether it's short-circuted, low performing, broken or missing. When the system indentifies a faulty panel, it replaces it with one from a warehouse stacked with  new panels. 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: Oh, that's very interesting, but can we see it in action, maybe a demo? 

-TEAM: Of course! {we do scenarios, describing robot movements} Here you will see the robot operating. In addition to scanning,indentifing and replacing, it also cleans. 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: Oh, it cleans too? 

-TEAM: Well, why not. Using compressed air and water collected from the rain our system is able to clean the  solar panels contactless therefore causing no harm to it’s surface. 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: I’m Impressed ! 

-TEAM: At first we had something else in mind. We had thought that the bridge would simply pass and look for problematic panels . In other words, it would save you the trouble of searching for the faulty ones, but this idea improved, and eventually we designed it in such a way that it could also replace them. In addition , you may not care about this from a buisness point of view but all the solar panels in the world that are currently installed will be eventually replaced within 10-15 years because solar farms would rather replace all their panels than search for the faulty ones when their energy production drops, which means a huge amount of  waste. So basically, apart from reaching the maximum efficiency of the panels, we also save a  tremendous amount of pollution. 

-POTENTIAL BUYERS: That is perfect! Thank you very much! 

-TEAM: You can find additional information about our project on Robotica's website, social media, and the internet if you search for our team.
